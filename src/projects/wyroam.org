Wyroam is a custom interface for viewing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten][zettelkasten]] or /[[https://roamresearch.com][roam]]/ style interconnected notes. It uses the [[https://www.orgroam.com][org roam]] note format.

The backend that parses the notes is written in Rust, and can parse hundereds of notes in mere milliseconds into a GraphQL database.

The frontend, written in NextJS, renders a split note viewing setup, a vertical tab list with keyboard caretting controls, and a graph rendering view as well as a fuzzy note searching menu.

There are also several other features, like LaTeX rendering, file linking and open on click within the graph.

This project was developed for a Computer Science project, and thus the release of the source code will be delayed.
