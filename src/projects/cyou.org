✨ Code Your Own Universe ✨

A scriptable cellular automata web simulator made with the Yew framework and scriptable through Rhai.script.

This software was developed as an interactive playground for the accompanying hackathon lecture on Cellular Automata: a crash course into discrete computational modelling at ESF CoCo 2023.
