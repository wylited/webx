#+title: Demonsend
#+filetags: :Rust:Unix:daemon:UDP:multicast:

Demonsend is a unix daemon client for the Localsend [[https://github.com/localsend/protocol][protocol]]. [[https://localsend.org][Localsend]] lacked a command line interface, which demonsend implements.
Alongside it, an [[github.com/wylited/localsend/][implementation]] of the protocol in Rust as a library was written.

The unix daemon is interfaceable through the binary client, or through IPC on the socket at ~/tmp/demonsend.sock~.
