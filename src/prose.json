Because it will serve as a foundation for our *thesis statement*.\nFirst, let's talk about our *thesis statement*, an effective thesis will plan an argument for us. This is because an argument tends to lend to a predetermined essay structure.\nHow do we create this argument? Well, once you read the text, there is almost always an interplay/dichotomy/tension between two key concepts creating the effect. Nine out of ten times, it's Nature vs. Artificial. Nature vs. Artificial is always a good argument to make, and it's so prevalent everywhere.\nSo how does the technique play into making the argument? We can split our general technique into the two key concepts again. This is better shown with an example.\nSay our technique provided is Imagery. Taking Nature vs. Artificial, the beginning of our *thesis statement* can take the form of\nThe author presents a dichotomy/tension between natural imagery and artificial imagery in order to create effect.\nNow, you need to also be careful when implementing the effect. You absolutely need to discuss a specific effect. What do I mean by that?\nSay, for example, our effect is Atmosphere. We cannot just say in order to create atmosphere, but what type of atmosphere? This could be melancholic or eulogical, maybe foreshadowing, cacolgic, nostalgic, hopeful or reminiscent. You get my point, try to be specific and correct to the text about the type of effect created.\nAnd finally, possibly most importantly, we have the part that the question will not ask. Why?. In your essay, you must answer why the effect is being created through the technique. Here, we need to consider the authorial intent or edifying message.\nThis will help us finalize our *thesis statement*.\nThe author presents a dichotomy/tension between natural imagery and artificial imagery to create an effect  in order to convey an idea …\nHowever, our why will go further than just the introduction's *thesis statement*, in our conclusion, we must also consider the global and wider perspective of the reader in relation to the edifying message. You want to say something insightful and nuanced about the text and how it relates to literature as a whole.\nSo to recap, our *thesis statement* presents a dichotomy or tension between two sides of a technique, to create a specific effect in order to convey an idea. And our conclusion focuses on the wider implications of this idea the author raises.\n\n** The Structure\nYou have a few options for structuring your essay. Assuming that we are aiming for an introduction, 3 body paragraphs and a conclusion, you can either structure it thematically, chronologically or technically.\nA technical structure would lend the topic sentence of each body paragraph to a certain technique, and the effect is created.\nA chronological structure will analyze the text in the same order that the text would be read.\nA thematic structure will focus each body paragraph on a specific theme, in relation to the question.\nAll of these structures have their pros and cons, and I won't be the one to tell you which one to use, as it depends on your style.\nHowever, what I will suggest using is a mixed structure that develops off of your thesis. What do I mean? If you followed the same way to create a thesis as outlined above, you can structure your body paragraphs based off of your argument.\nThe first thematic technique, perhaps Natural Imagery and the effect it builds\nThe second thematic technique, Artificial imagery and the effect it builds.\nThe interplay/tension between the two techniques and the effect it builds.\nThis lends very well while planning, as you don't actually need to plan your structure beyond the thesis!\n<2024-10-09 Wed>\n","tags":["guide","essay","english"],"html":"<main><section></section><h2>The Guiding Questions and Theses</h2><section><p>It&apos;s probably impossible to emphasize just how much this matters.

They typically constantly defy societal expectations, are a higher class than most people and yet are adored by the masses. Why is this?\n\nRecently we studied about Arthur Miller, a strong criticst of the American Dream. He was often unfairly accused of being a communist due to his connections and associations. We will use him as an analysis point for this claim.\n\nLets first begin with why he was a strong crictist. Arthur Miller was born in Harlem, New York City with two successful middle class workers for his parents. Following the Wall Street crash of 1929, the Miller family fell into a crisis. Suddenly, their house in Harlem and their summer house were sold for a chummy place in Brooklyn. Throughout his childhood, Arthur Miller experienced both the highs and lows of the American Dream. He learned from an early to be a rationalist criticist.\n\nOnce Arthur Miller started his career. His plays tended to criticized the American Dream, such as the play, \"Death of a Salesman\", where Miller grapples with the loss of identity and a mans fall following an ability to accept change within himself and society. This play was heavily criticized and boycotted by the American Legion due to the themes that were critical of the American Dream and capitalism. Through the \"Death of a Salesman\" Arthur Miller presented a strong criticism against the lusted-over American Dream.\n\nLikewise, the play \"The Crucible\" was a commentary of the Red Scare and McArthyism induced fear and anxiety in the American society as well as the atmost unfair treatment. \"The Crucible\" achieved this by reflecting the contemporary issue with the Salem Witch trials of the late 1700's. The Crucible was so popular and sucessful, that it single handed made the Salem Witch Trials famous. On an even deeper level, Arthur Miller himself was persecuted with the same accusatory trials that the Salem Witch Trials showcases as injust and unfair. What likely influenced Miller to write this play was his connections to the League of American Writers, comprised mostly of communists, as well as the Federal Theatre Project, which got closed in 1939 due to Congress worries over Communist infiltration.\n\nArthur Miller was also born Jewish-Polish, although he was never overly religious, he often spoke out against anti-semistic behaviour and attempted to get many plays showcased about anti-semistism. However, these plays were never shown to an audience due to the American Theatre refusing to deal with controversial topics. In frustration that his plays were constantly being denied, Arthur Miller decided to write a speech titled \"Concerning the Jews who Write\" and later his first novel \"Focus\", a titular reference to jewish concentration camps, discusses discrimination in post World War 2 America and the issue of scapegoating.\n\n< I could another reference to how Arthur Miller was against Misogyny and refused to sexually exploit Marilyn Monroe, but thats not a good point >\n\nSo we can see how several societal aspects can influence an artists life and cause them to stand out and voice their opinions. This key trait they have makes them unique and sought-after, raising them to fame and popularity. We can observe the raw desire for controversy and change humans encompass and the extent to which they idolize but also criticize those who embody it.\n\n<2024-10-18 Fri>\n","tags":["essay","protests","crucible","communism","plays","misogyny","american","art"],"html":"<main><section><p>Many artists are known to be highly controversial.

I mean to take no offense to them personally, but their public exhibition of laziness creates a mental link in the observers relating those who are lazy or sleeping all the time and being in the lowest class of human beings.\n</p><p>The effect is exemplified through the contrast between me and my father at home. my father, who grew up in india  and was exposed to the lower cases, developed a natural inhibition towards laziness most commonly portrayed through sleeping during the day or slacking off. On the other hand, since I was raised in a developed country, I did not witness such behaviour and form those links.\n</p><p>This lead to several arguments, where I am convinced that me napping during the day is just to recuperate physical and mental strength, while my dad believes that I have become lazy and complacent.\n</p><p>Although this is not a bad mentality for societ to adopt, it presents how easily prejudcies can be formed in our soicety through our constant judgement.
