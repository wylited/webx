Won't you hold your flowers\\
to my laminated childhood photos\\
\\
the sky blue tinges of which\\
fade into a pastel lavender\\
\\
incense burnt to a stump\\
and smoke trails, like mother's fingers\\
through my hair, tender, oblique\\
\\
creases in the photo\\
fold like the distance between us\\
as memories pool like spilt milk\\
on my weathered windowsill\\
where we lay, sedentary, untethered\\
comforted with familiarity\\
\\
our past, preserved in acrylic\\
yellows and frays at the edges,\\
while the room grows heavy with ashes\\
of things I could only avow\\
to you.\\
