#+filetags: :poem:anxiety:

anxiety consumes me\\
I call for you\\
a soft voice warms me;\\
Iâ€™m no longer alone.\\
A fragile connection,\\
shattered by a vague press\\
anxiety calls me.\\

I babble on\\
to myself,\\
avoiding the faces in the dark,\\
and those in the light,\\
watching me.\\

constellations, a million miles away,\\
judge me incessantly,\\
yet you weave them into shapes,\\
a sharp comfort in chaos.\\
