Summer rain, relentless yet timeless,\\
breaks away from the perpetual.\\
like hands on a clock ticking back, quite fast,\\
I seem stuck in my own past.\\
 \\
pitter patter, faster than you can say,\\
washes away all that remains.\\
a wind of cool, diverging the heatwaves;\\
let the reverb of the static, push you away.\\
 \\
Yet, the sticky air,\\
befalls me thereafter.\\
The comfort only bringing exasperation;\\
the passing rain, never endless.\\
