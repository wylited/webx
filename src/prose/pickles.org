mental health,\\
people say its quite fickle.\\
and with the cards i was dealt,\\
I'd say im in a pickle.\\
\\
for i have fermented for too long\\
kept oil locked up in a jar\\
and an elephant away with it too\\
but Mason can't take it any more\\
rough oil, sanding down the glass\\
till it can no longer take the pressure\\
and explodes with glass shards\\
\\
The cucumber implodes,\\
spewing fire all over\\
igniting the oil\\
red hot shards,\\
right infront of houston\\
